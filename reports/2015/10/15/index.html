        <h1>Investigation Report</h1>
        <h2>Brief summary of events on 10/15/15</h2>

        <h3>What happened?</h3>
        <p>It was discovered that Appljuze's base was attacked and savaged by a group of non-trusted players. Several blocks of lava were placed, blocks were destroyed, animals were slain, and obscenities were made to deface the area. The offending players were:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>ccmolik</li>
                <li>R3cursive</li>
                <li>RustyBower</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There is evidence to believe that all three accounts may be attributed to a single user based on geo-IP coordinate data.</p>

        <h3>How was it fixed?</h3>
        <p>The issue was quickly resolved and fixed methodically and easily:</p>
        <li>
                <li>Permanently banned all players responsible.</li>
                <li>Rolled back all changes made by these groups of players in the area.</li>
                <li>Reimbursed Appljuze with replacement mobs to his former mob farms.</li>
        </li>

        <h3>How can this be prevented in the future?</h3>
        <p>After looking at how we handle in-game trustworthiness and other factors, a few reforms have been made to how we give players privileges to build in specific areas or to use certain commands.</p>
        <ul>
                <li>[<em>Trusted</em>] group removed</li>
                <li>[<em>Verified</em>] and [<em>Telegram</em>] groups added</li>
                <ul>
                        <li>[<em>Telegram</em>] is reserved only for members of the community who are actually joined in on the <a href="http://s.j-f.co/1MmDHtv" target="_blank">Telegram group message</a>. This is the best way we communicate and the highest form of trustworthiness.</li>
                        <li>[<em>Verified</em>] (also represented by a checkmark in-game) is reserved for players whose real-life identification can be supported by at least two members of the Telegram group. Joining Telegram should always be the preferred way to become trusted, but if Telegram is not something someone wants, their only other option is to have two or more members in the Telegram group vouch for their real-life, physical identity.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Call for all players building outside of the main city to contact jflory7 to extend region protection over their bases ASAP!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Thanks for being patient in all of this, guys. Hopefully this kind of behavior is not something we will have to deal with too often, so ideally setting up these guidelines should pace ourselves for a better experience in the long-run. Later on, we plan to add official rules to the server, but this is being saved for a larger group discussion in the future.</p>
