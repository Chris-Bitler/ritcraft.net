# RITCraft-Site
Website repository for the RIT Minecraft server.


## What is it?
This repository is for the RIT Minecraft server (for now, nicknamed "RITCraft") website. RITCraft was started in October 2015 and is open to all students at the Rochester Institute of Technology.

**IP**: *rit.j-f.co*
**Website**: *[rit.j-f.co](http://rit.j-f.co)*

## What should it have?
This website only needs a few basic things, as detailed below:

* Introduction ("What is RITCraft?")
* Server Information (where and how to join)
* Server Plans (even a manual, editable bullet list would be fine)
* How to Help (link to this repo, plus plug for Telegram group)

### Introduction
The following text blurb can serve as the introduction for the server.

> The RIT Minecraft server (also known as "RITCraft") is a semi-vanilla Minecraft server hosted by RIT students, for RIT students. The server is hosted on a machine on the university campus (visit derezzed.student.rit.edu to see) and is intended as a place for Minecrafters across campus together. The purpose of the server is fairly casual - some of us work together to work on the town, some of us work on our own creations, and some of us just spend a **lot** of time in the mines. Whatever your tastes are, there's a way for you to get involved!
> We're also very open to suggestions, so if you have an idea of a plugin or "thing" to add to make the server awesome, we want to hear your suggestions to make the server more fun! You can get in touch with us as explained farther down on the page.

### Server Information
The following text blurb can serve as the information for the server.

> The server runs on the latest stable version of PaperSpigot, a fork of the popular Minecraft server software Spigot. We try to be on the latest version of Minecraft as possible. To join the server, add rit.j-f.co to your server list.

If possible, the IP can be prettied and fancied as necessary.

### Server Plans
The following text blurb can be used as a filler for the area for the plans section.

> We have several different projects going on at any given time. Some of the things currently on our to-do list areâ€¦

### How to Help
This part of the site can be an almost direct copy-paste of the last paragraph of this README.

## I want to help!
Want to help with either this website or RITCraft? Awesome! Feel free to submit pull requests to this repo if you want to help with the website, or if you want to help with the server, join our Telegram group chat. To prevent the spam bots from finding us, we won't link the invite URL here, but the link is constantly cycled through the server in-game - look for it there!
