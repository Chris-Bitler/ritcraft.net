# RITcraft-Site
Website repository for the RIT Minecraft server.


## What is it?
This repository is for the RIT Minecraft server (also known as "RITcraft") website. RITcraft was started in October 2015 and is open to all students at the Rochester Institute of Technology.

* **IP**: *rit.j-f.co*
* **Website**: *[rit.j-f.co](http://rit.j-f.co)*


## What should it have?
This website only needs a few basic things, as detailed below:

* Introduction ("What is RITCraft?")
* Server Information (where and how to join)
* Server Plans (even a manual, editable bullet list would be fine)
* How to Help (link to this repo, plus plug for Telegram group)

More might be added or expanded to this over time.


## I want to help!
Want to help with either this website or RITCraft? Awesome! Feel free to submit pull requests to this repo if you want to help with the website, or if you want to help with the server, join our Telegram group chat. To prevent the spam bots from finding us, we won't link the invite URL here, but the link is constantly cycled through the server in-game - look for it there!
